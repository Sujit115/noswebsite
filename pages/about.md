To know more about __Guru__, in pan-[Indian traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_religions), Guru is
more than a teacher, in Sanskrit guru means the one who dispels the darkness and takes towards light,
traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the guru serving as a "counselor, who helps mold values,
shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who
helps in the spiritual evolution of a student". A guru is also one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover
the same potentialities that the guru has already realized. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru)
